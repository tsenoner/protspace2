### Local Development with `scatter-board-library`

The project uses a locally developed library, `scatter-board-library`, which is built with Rollup and designed to work with React.

Setting Up the Library

```bash
cd scatter-board-library
yarn install
```

##### Yarn Link for Local Development

To work on both the frontend application and the library simultaneously, you can use Yarnâ€™s linking feature. This way, any change in the library will be immediately available in the frontend.

###### Create a Global Link for the Library:

In the `scatter-board-library` directory, run:

```bash
yarn link
```

###### Link the Library in the Frontend Project:

In a separate terminal, navigate back to the `root` directory and run:

```bash
yarn link scatter-board-library
```

This creates a symbolic link from your local `scatter-board-library` to the `node_modules` folder of your root(frontend) project.

The `scatter-board-library` uses `Rollup` to bundle the library, producing both `CommonJS` and `ES module` builds along with `TypeScript` declaration files.

In the `scatter-board-library` directory, start the `Rollup` build in watch mode to automatically rebuild the library when changes are made:

```bash
cd scatter-board-library
yarn rollup-build-lib
```
